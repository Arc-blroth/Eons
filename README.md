Write. Program. Draw. Compose. _Create_.

Eons is a script that installs a variety of (mostly) open-source tools given a clean Windows 11 install. It's intended for people who exercise all parts of the creative process regularly.

## Running

On a clean Windows 11 machine, open `powershell` with adminstrative privileges. This is of course dangerous, but Eons _is_ a script to install software. _Arc'blroth is not responsible for any damages incurred by this script_.

In that powershell window, run
```
.\eons.ps1
```
